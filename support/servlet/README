Your project's WAR should include the following files:

WEB-INF/app/app.js
WEB-INF/narwhal/lib (including all Narwhal and Jack libraries)
WEB-INF/narwhal/narwhal-rhino.js
WEB-INF/narwhal/narwhal.js
WEB-INF/classes/org/jackjs/JackServlet.class (compiled from JackServlet.java)
WEB-INF/lib/js.jar

The last statement of app.js must be the main Jack function. Alternatively, define a "function" parameter in web.xml with the name of the function.

Optionally specify different files by changing the "modulePath" and "module" parameters for the servlet.
