JSGI & Jack
===========

JSGI is a web server interface specification for JavaScript, inspired by Ruby's Rack ([http://rack.rubyforge.org/](http://rack.rubyforge.org/)) and Python's WSGI ([http://www.wsgi.org/](http://www.wsgi.org/)). It provides a common API for connecting JavaScript frameworks and applications to webservers.

Jack is a collection of JSGI compatible handlers (connect web servers to JavaScript web application/frameworks), middleware (intercept and manipulate requests to add functionality), and other utilities (to help build middleware, frameworks, and applications).

JSGI Specification
------------------

View the [JSGI specification](http://jackjs.org/jsgi-spec.html).


Example JSGI Application
------------------------

    function(env) {
        return {
            status : 200,
            headers : {"Content-Type":"text/plain"},
            body : ["Hello world!"]
        };
    }


JSGI vs. Rack
-------------

JSGI applications are simply functions, rather than objects that respond to the "call" method. The body must have a `forEach` method which yields objects which have a `toByteString` method, as opposed to Strings.


JSGI vs. WSGI
-------------

WSGI uses a `start_response` function to set the HTTP status code and headers, rather than returning them in an array. JSGI is similar to WSGI 2.0: [http://www.wsgi.org/wsgi/WSGI_2.0](http://www.wsgi.org/wsgi/WSGI_2.0).
